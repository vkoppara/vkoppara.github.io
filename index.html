        Founded in 2020, ShutterForge began as a dream to preserve memories in the most beautiful way possible. Our founder, Nirvan Kopparapu, a self-taught photographer with a deep passion for the craft, started the journey by capturing family portraits from his small home studio. Over the years, ShutterForge has evolved into a professional studio housing a dynamic 20-member team dedicated to delivering high-quality photography services.

        Our growth is a result of hard work, creativity, and the unwavering trust of our clients. In just five years, we have served hundreds of families, businesses, and organizations, reaching a milestone of ₹15,00,000 turnover in Q4 2024.
